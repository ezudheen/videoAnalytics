				
	---------------------Presentation layer---------------------

	Input: Person ID, start time,  start date,  end time,  end date
	
	Output: Generate the route of the person during this time interval, Persons who are located near to this route
	

	---------------------Business layer---------------------

	Input: 	Entries from "Table_raw_location_info", "Table_frame_details" and "Table_camera_info"

	Output: Entries to "Table_actual_location_info"

	Process
		1. Chose an entry from "Table_raw_location_info"
		2. Compute its time information the details from "Table_frame_details"
		3. Comptue its actual location information using the details from "Table_camera_info"
		4. Generate a "Table_actual_location_info" entry
	
	---------------------Data layer---------------------

	Input: vedio stream form camera, learning models
		
	Output: Entries to "Table_raw_location_info" and "Table_frame_details"

	Process

		1. Slice the vedio input to images based on a given frame rate
		2. Generate table entries to "Table_frame_details" 
		3. Compare the the image with its predecessor and compted a differentiator
		4. Compare the computed differnciator with a threshold value
		5. Filter the images based on the above comparison and select a minimal set of useful images
		6. Check the presence of person_ids in the image
			6.1 Classify the image using the learing model corresponding to the person_id
		7. Generate a table entry to "Table_raw_location_info" based on the above step

	---------------------Learning Models----------------------

	Input: entries from "Table_personal_info"

	Output: individual learning models corresponding to each person's features

	Process
		1. Extract the identification details of a person_id
		2. Gernerate a image classifier model, CNN
		3. Trian this models using the face images, empolyee number of the person
			 	
	---------------------Data Base---------------------

			Tables

				1. Table_personal_info: Personal details
					<person_id, face_image, employee_number>
				2. Table_raw_location_info: Information exctraced from vedio processing
					<person_id, vedio_image_id, pixel_cordinate_x, pixel_cordinate_y>	
				3. Table_actual_location_info: Location information comuted by Business Layer
					<person_id, location_x, location_y, location_z, time, date>
				4. Table_camera_info: Camera information
					<camera_id, location_x, location_y, location_z, distance_to_floor, angle_of_camera>
				5. Table_frame_details: Frame image information
					<image_id, camera_id, date, time>
