	Input: vedio stream form camera, multilabel_image_classifier
		
	Output: Entries to "Table_raw_location_info" and "Table_frame_details"

	Process

		1. Slice the vedio input to images based on a given frame rate
		2. Generate table entries to "Table_frame_details" 
		3. Compare the the image with its predecessor and compute a differentiator
		4. Compare the computed differnciator with a threshold value
		5. Filter the images based on the above comparison and select a minimal set of useful images
		7. Extract the face objects from the image
		6. Classify the face object using the "multilabel_image_classifier" 
		7. Generate a table entry to "Table_raw_location_info" based on the above step
