	Function: Object Identifier

	Input: an Image file, Image identifier

	Output: A set of images (objects of type face)

	Process

		1. Create a pretrained object classifier
			1.1  MTCCN seems OK, please read the reference
		2. Extract the face objects, compute the center of these face objects	
		3. Returns a structure containing the <image, pixel_cordinate_x, pixel_cordinate_y>

 	Function: Image Classifier
	Input: entries from "Table_personal_info"

	Output: multilabel image classifier, which classify a person using his face image

	Process
		1. Generate a training and testing set using the data from "Table_personal_info" 
		2. Gernerate a multilabel image classifier model, CNN
		3. Trian this models using the above data
